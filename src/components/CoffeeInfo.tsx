//       <p> Tzofzik is a roastery and coffee cart located in Beit Yehoshua. It began its journey </p>
//       <p> in late 2018 when owner Or Ziman transitioned from the Tel Aviv caf√© and restaurant</p>
//       <p> scene back to Beit Yehoshua, where he was born and raised. Or's desire to introduce </p>
//       <p> local residents to the world of coffee started with a coffee cart, the first in the </p>
//       <p> area to serve locally roasted coffee. Over time, Or delved deeper into coffee and roasting, </p>
//       <p> winning competitions like the "Best Coffee" competition in 2024, leading workshops, and </p>
//       <p> participating in local and international initiatives. What began as a small roastery </p>
//       <p> in a family farm room has grown into a significant player in the Israeli coffee scene, </p>
//       <p> supplying fresh coffee to hundreds of private and business clients. At Tzofzik, Or and </p>
//       <p> his team emphasize quality, from raw materials to packaging, while maintaining accessibility </p>
//       <p> and fostering a down-to-earth approach.</p>
//       <h4>Bloom's Coffee</h4>
//       <p>A specialty coffee roastery founded by Assaf Hania, who caught the specialty coffee bug </p>
//       <p>in Melbourne, Australia. Since then, his passion for bringing specialty coffee to a wider </p>
//       <p>audience has only grown. After returning to Israel, Assaf opened a coffee cart in Pardes </p>
//       <p>Hanna-Karkur and, shortly after, established a nearby roastery. The roastery continues to grow </p>
//       <p>and gain widespread recognition, thanks to Assaf's personal touch and the uniqueness of the coffee.</p>
